# Belly_Button_Challenge

Belly Button Bacteria App
This project focuses on analyzing the bacteria present in individuals' belly buttons. The goal of the assignment was to pull data from a JSON file and visualize it on a website using charts.

Overview
In this project, I:

*Created a GitHub repository to host the project.

*Set up a GitHub Pages site to deploy the project easily.

*Used the starter HTML code and then developed an app.js file that would manage the data and update the visualizations.

*Created dynamic charts that display information about the types of bacteria found in individuals' belly buttons. The charts update based on the selection from a dropdown menu.

*The application uses a dropdown menu that allows users to select an individual and then dynamically updates the charts and displays information about the bacteria present in their belly buttons. The data is pulled correctly from a given URL containing a JSON file.

Features
Interactive Dropdown: Select an individual from the dropdown to view bacteria data.
Dynamic Graphs: The charts update based on the selected individual, showing different bacteria present in their belly button.
Data Handling: Data is fetched from a URL containing a JSON file and processed to display in the charts.

Tools and Resources Used
HTML for structure
JavaScript (app.js) for dynamic behavior and pulling data
Charts.js for visualizing the data
GitHub Pages for easy deployment
Peer Assistance and Tutor Help for troubleshooting
